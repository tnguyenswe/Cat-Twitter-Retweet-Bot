This bot was created because I wanted to learn about the twitter API as well as how to implement it into Python.

Several things will be required to run this program on your own personal twitter account. You will need a developer account 
in order to gain the following:
Consumer_API_Key = "XXX"
Consumer_Secret_Key = "XXX"
Access_Token = "XXX"
Access_Token_Secret = "XXX"

I used the tweepy API as well, so you may have to import that into your IDE. 

Once you have all the above, you should be ready to run this bot.

If you would like to see my personal implementation, you can check out my twitter down below:

Have fun!
